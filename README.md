# ⚙️ Task 3 — Automation Script (CodeAlpha Python Internship)
## 📘 Overview
This task is about automating a small real-life repetitive process using Python.  
I chose to build a simple script that extracts all email addresses from a text file and saves them to another file.
## 🧩 Features
- Reads content from a `.txt` file.  
- Uses regular expressions to find valid email addresses.  
- Removes duplicate emails.  
- Saves the extracted results to a new `.txt` file.  
- Simple and fast — runs directly from the terminal.
## 🧠 Concepts Used
- `os` — for file operations.  
- `re` — for pattern matching and email extraction.  
- `file handling` — for reading and writing text files.  
- (Optional) `shutil` or `requests` — for other automation tasks.
